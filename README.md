# Term Project

Add design docs in *images/*

## Instructions to setup and run project
Clearly explain the steps required to install and configure necessary packages,
for both the server and the client, and the sequence of steps required to get
your application running.

## Running Instructions
- Make sure nodejs is installed. If it's not, install [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Make sure mongoDB is installed. If it's not, install the [community edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)
- Run all **`$ ...`** in terminal
- In a terminal window, in the root directory, run **`$ npm i`**.
- In a new terminal window, navigate to the client directory (**`$ cd client`**), then run **`$ npm i`**. Finally, run **`$ npm start`**
- In a new terminal window, run **`$ mongod`**. Note: if you're using macOS with the package manager Homebrew, you may have to use **`$ brew services start mongodb-community@<version_number>`** instead.
- In a new terminal window, navigate to the server directory (**`$ cd server`**), then run **`$ npm i`**. Run **`$ npm run start`** to start the server. In a new terminal in the server directory, run **`$ npm run initDB`** to initialize the database with some initial data, including the administrator account with email: admin@admin.com, displayName: ADMIN, password: password123. Alternatively, to define your own admin account you can run **`$ node init.js mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/phreddit <admin_email> <admin_displayName> <admin_password>`**. Both will initialize the database with default data, as seen in prior assignments.
- To run tests, go to the root directory and run **`$ npm test`**
